    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Tristin, and I’m a 1<sup>st</sup> year student at <abbr tittle= "Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. I spend a lot of time studying for school at the moment, however when I’m not doing that I love to be outside hiking and enjoying nature. My boyfriend recently adopted a kitten, so I also have been dealing with that little rocket of energy the past few weeks. His name is Quark and he's super adorable as seen in the photo below, so I don't mind his energy. <em>I am a huge animal lover</em>, and if my roommates weren’t allergic to animals I would have a ton of my own by now!

        I work at a coffee shop and I love to make different drinks on the espresso machine. I <b>definitely</b> could be considered a caffeine addict. I do my fair share of cooking and baking, and it’s something I really enjoy. This time of year is great for all the fall veggies that are ready to be harvested, and there’s usually tons of pumpkin pie to go around at my house. For more leisure activities I can be found drawing, painting, or playing video games. I love my Switch and use it way more than I should.

        Below are some photos of me. One is of myself on a canoe, and another is of my boyfriend and I! Both were taken this summer when I went camping.
