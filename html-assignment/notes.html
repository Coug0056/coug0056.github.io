   <h2>Tags I have Learned</h2>
   <p>
     Below is a list of some new tags I have learned while taking Responsive Web Design 1 this semester.   
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>The ul Tag</dt>
        <dd>This is a tag that represents an unordered list. You can use it to create lists where the order of the items doesn't matter. However you must tag all the items in the list as <em>li</em> tags when using the ul tag.</dd>
        
        <dt>The li Tag</dt>
        <dd>This tag is used within the <em>ul</em>ul. This is for listing items within the list, and is used after the <em>ul</em> or <em>ol</em> tags, which are the start of ordered or unordered lists. You cannot use these on their own.</dd>

        <dt>The h1 Tag</dt>
        <dd>This tag is used for creating a header on your page. The header with  the smallest number will be the most prominent on your page. You can use the tag with other numbers but they will be smaller on the page, and considered less important information. </dd>

        <dt>The head Tag</dt>
        <dd>This is the second tag that you input into your code. This contains important information about your webpage for the computer to read; including the tab name that will be displayed on the webpage.  </dd>

        <dt>The img src="your image here" Tag </dt>
        <dd>This is an important tag to include in your code if you want to include an image on your page. This tag tells the computer where your images is and where to insert it on the page. This only works if you have the image in a folder in the same initial file you started working on. This also works with the <em>alt= tag</em> which is an alternative featuring the description of the image. This is if the image cannot show up or the user is using a image description service on your website.</dd>
